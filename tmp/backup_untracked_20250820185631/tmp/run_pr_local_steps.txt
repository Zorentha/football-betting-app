PowerShell steps to create the PR locally (use this — you said PowerShell only)

1) Open PowerShell and cd to the repo root:
   cd C:\Users\lukas\zorentha-ai\football-betting-app

2) Set your PAT into the session (do NOT paste the token here):
   $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'ghp_<YOUR_NEW_PAT_WITH_REPO_SCOPE>'

3) Run the sanitized create script (this will trim surrounding characters and POST the PR):
   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tmp/sanitize_and_create_pr.ps1

What the script does:
- sanitizes $env:GITHUB_TOKEN in the current process (removes surrounding <, >, quotes, spaces),
- calls tmp/auto_create_pr.ps1 which performs the GitHub API POST to create the PR with:
    head = feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased
    base = main
    title/body prefilled

4) After the command completes:
- If successful you will see JSON with html_url, number, title, state.
- If it fails, copy the full output (including any "Response body:" printed by the script) and paste it here.

Alternative single-line (if you prefer not to run the sanitize helper):
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'ghp_<YOUR_NEW_PAT>'; curl.exe -v -H "Authorization: token $env:GITHUB_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -d '{"title":"Make OpenAI expected output tokens configurable and remove hardcoded cap","head":"feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased","base":"main","body":"See PR_DESCRIPTION.md in repository for full details."}' https://api.github.com/repos/Zorentha/football-betting-app/pulls

Troubleshooting:
- If you still get 401:
  - Confirm the token is copied exactly (no extra angle brackets or quotes).
  - Confirm token scopes include repo (classic) or fine‑grained branch-scoped write for Pull Requests + repository contents.
  - Re-run the sanitize script above (it trims surrounding characters).
- If you get validation error (422) about no common history, use head = feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased (script uses rebased branch).

What to paste back here:
- The exact console output produced by tmp/sanitize_and_create_pr.ps1 (or the curl output). I will confirm the PR URL and next steps.
