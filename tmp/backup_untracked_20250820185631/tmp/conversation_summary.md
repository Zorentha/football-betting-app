I will produce a comprehensive chronological summary of the entire conversation and the work performed so far. I will include the user's explicit intents, the technical stack, the files read/modified/created, the exact commands run, diagnostics performed, problems encountered, the current status (what is saved and what remains), and immediate next steps aligned to the user's explicit requests. I will make sure to include precise file names, key code snippets (where relevant), and exact commands the assistant executed or asked the user to run. This will allow continuation of development without losing context.

Key checkpoints to cover:
- Initial goal: have ChatGPT-5 produce per-tip integer probabilities, show them in the UI, and save only after user inspection.
- Remove hardcoded 1200-token cap and make it configurable.
- Ensure UI consistency between predictedScore and 3-way probabilities.
- Prevent rerunning analysis if saved in DB (only re-run with ?force=1).
- Improve OpenAI reliability (timeouts, retries) and add calibration tooling.
- Files changed: backend openaiAnalysisService, routes, DB migration, frontend AIAnalysis.jsx & MatchCard.jsx, helper scripts, tmp artifacts, CI and docs.
- Diagnostics: Vite proxy, OpenAI timeouts, missing annotate file, then successfully ran annotate, saved annotated tips to DB for fixture 1435547.
- Git/GitHub workflow: prepared patch, installed Git, pushed branch, installed gh CLI, and created PR (or prepared link) — user interaction done to create PR.

1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - User main goal:
     - Let ChatGPT‑5 itself return per-betting-tip integer probabilities and reasoning, display them in the UI next to each betting tip, and only persist model‑annotated predictions to DB after the user inspects raw model output.
   - Additional explicit requirements:
     - Diagnose and mitigate OpenAI reliability issues (timeouts) and local dev proxy ECONNREFUSED Vite errors.
     - Prevent duplicate re-runs of analysis if saved version exists; only allow forced re-run (?force=1).
     - Ensure consistency: predictedScore, three-way probabilities, and betting tips should not contradict each other (e.g., predictedScore draw -> draw probability highest after normalization/rebalance).
     - Remove hardcoded "1200 token" cap in OpenAI payloads and make output token hint configurable.
     - Provide robust dev workflow scripts, tests, and a reliable CI that runs unit & DB-persistence smoke tests.
     - User demanded to see raw ChatGPT‑5 output before saving; assistant must show raw output, then save only after user confirmation.
   - Immediate interactive tasks user asked to perform:
     - "uruchom i pokaż surową odpowiedź" — run strict annotate and show raw model output for fixture 1435547.
     - Later: push branch and create PR (user required help performing these steps).

2. Key Technical Concepts / Stack:
   - Backend: Node.js + Express. Main entry: server.js. Routes: src/routes/bettingRoutes.js.
   - OpenAI integration: src/services/openaiAnalysisService.js using the OpenAI Responses API pattern, AbortController timeouts, retry/backoff helper, safeParseJSONFromText, annotation follow‑up stage.
   - Frontend: React + Vite. Components modified/read: src/components/AIAnalysis.jsx, src/components/MatchCard.jsx.
   - Database: SQLite via src/services/databaseService.js (database/football_betting.db). match_predictions table updated to store prediction_metadata and calibration_version (migration script prepared).
   - Calibration: temperature-scaling calibrator (tmp/calibrator.json), scripts/train-calibrator.js, scripts/eval-calibration.js, and scripts/dump-predictions-labeled.js.
   - Dev tooling & scripts:
     - scripts/save-annotated-to-db.js (persist tmp annotate into DB)
     - scripts/run-unit-tests.js
     - scripts/test-calibration-persistence.js
     - scripts/push_changes_https.sh, scripts/run_push_with_url.sh, scripts/fix_identity_and_push.sh
     - scripts/install_gh_windows.ps1 (install GitHub CLI)
     - scripts/install_gh_windows.ps1 and scripts/install_gh_windows.ps1 output used to install gh
     - tmp/ artifacts: tmp/annotate_strict_response_1435547.json, tmp/analyze_1435547_out.json, tmp/fixture_1435547_after.json, tmp/feature-openai-expected-output-tokens.patch
   - CI: GitHub Actions workflow added at .github/workflows/ci.yml to run unit tests and DB persistence smoke test.

3. Files and Code Sections Examined, Modified, or Created:
   - src/services/openaiAnalysisService.js
     - Why: central OpenAI call logic (callOpenAI wrapper, openAIRequest with AbortController and token budgeting).
     - Key edits:
       - Removed previous hard-coded expectedOutputTokens default of 1200.
       - Introduced expectedOutputTokens = process.env.OPENAI_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_TOKENS || undefined (no hard cap unless env set).
       - openAIRequest now computes est = estimateTokens(inputText) + (Number.isFinite(this.expectedOutputTokens) ? this.expectedOutputTokens : 0).
       - callOpenAI wrapper and annotate follow-up maintained; annotate prompt used to ask model for JSON array of objects for bettingTips with probability & reasoning.
       - applyCalibration(probs, calibrator, marketProbs, blendWeight) implemented (temperature scaling + optional market blending).
     - Importance: Ensures OpenAI calls have robust retry/timeouts and calibration; removed hardcoded token cap per user's explicit request.
   - src/routes/bettingRoutes.js
     - Why: route handlers for /fixtures/:id/analysis and /fixtures/:id/analyze; ensures DB is checked before re-analysis and honor ?force=1.
     - Edits: ensure GET /analysis returns DB-saved analysis if exists; POST /analyze respects DB check and ?force=1 override.
   - src/services/databaseService.js
     - Why: read/write SQLite; savePrediction updates to accept prediction_metadata and calibration_version.
     - Edits: savePrediction signature updated; migration script scripts/migrate-add-prediction-metadata.js created to add prediction_metadata and calibration_version columns.
   - src/components/AIAnalysis.jsx
     - Why: present analysis UI and show per-tip probabilities; avoid triggering re-analysis on mount.
     - Edits:
       - Fetch only /api/betting/fixtures/:id/analysis on mount.
       - Normalize bettingTips into consistent shape: { type, probability, reasoning }.
       - Display: the analysis.predictedScore and formatted predictedOutcomeProbability, AI three-way probabilities (formattedProbabilities), bettingTips list with rounded per-tip probability if present or fallback ~confidencePercentage.
       - Added display of calibrationVersion (analysis.calibrationVersion) next to confidence badge.
       - Ensured per-tip probability rounding and fallback behavior.
   - src/components/MatchCard.jsx
     - Why: compact match-level UI; show calibrationVersion and top betting tip in a compact form.
     - Edits:
       - Added aiAnalysisState.calibrationVersion display and "Top recommendation" with probability shown if available.
       - Fetch stored analysis via /api/betting/fixtures/:id/analysis in useEffect.
   - scripts/save-annotated-to-db.js
     - Purpose: helper to read tmp/annotate_strict_response_1435547.json, parse it, and persist as prediction for fixture 1435547. Used to save user-confirmed annotated predictions into DB.
   - tmp files created/read:
     - tmp/payload_annotate_1435547.json (strict annotate prompt)
     - tmp/analyze_1435547_out.json (analysis output)
     - tmp/annotate_strict_response_1435547.json (raw strict model annotation saved) — content included:
       [
         {"type":"Over 2.5 goals","probability":64,"reasoning":"High xG ..."},
         {"type":"Both teams to score: Yes","probability":68,"reasoning":"..."},
         {"type":"Over 3.5 goals (small stake)","probability":46,"reasoning":"..."},
         {"type":"Rangers draw no bet","probability":35,"reasoning":"..."},
         {"type":"Correct score 2-2","probability":12,"reasoning":"..."}
       ]
     - tmp/fixture_1435547_after.json (analysis snapshot)
     - tmp/inspect_prediction_1435547.json (DB inspection exported)
     - tmp/calibrator.json (trained calibrator metadata)
     - tmp/feature-openai-expected-output-tokens.patch (patch containing changes)
   - scripts/* created:
     - scripts/push_changes_https.sh, scripts/run_push_with_url.sh, scripts/fix_identity_and_push.sh, scripts/install_gh_windows.ps1, scripts/run-unit-tests.js, scripts/test-calibration-persistence.js, scripts/train-calibrator.js, scripts/eval-calibration.js
   - CI:
     - .github/workflows/ci.yml added to run node scripts/run-unit-tests.js and node scripts/test-calibration-persistence.js on push/PR.

4. Problem Solving / Diagnostics Performed:
   - OpenAI reliability:
     - Implemented openAIRequest with AbortController and exponential backoff + jitter; callOpenAI wrapper used with increased baseTimeouts and retries.
     - Annotate flow for bettingTips: if parsedResponse.bettingTips lacked numeric probability, an annotate prompt is built and callOpenAI invoked to produce JSON-only array. safeParseJSONFromText used to parse outputs.
   - Token limit issue:
     - Found earlier code setting maxTokens: 1200 and replaced it by configurable OPENAI_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_TOKENS. Code now defaults to undefined to avoid hidden cap.
   - Duplicate analysis prevention:
     - Frontend changed to only call the saved-analysis endpoint and backend checks DB first before running analysis; analyze endpoint respects ?force=1.
   - Working with tmp outputs:
     - Executed POST /api/betting/openai/analyze with strict payload; saved model raw output to tmp/annotate_strict_response_1435547.json; user requested raw output shown — assistant displayed that raw JSON.
   - DB persistence:
     - User confirmed to save annotated tips to DB; scripts/save-annotated-to-db.js run and returned row id 218 — DB save succeeded and tmp/inspect_prediction_1435547.json was produced for inspection.
   - Git/GitHub flow:
     - Git initially missing in environment; assistant guided user to install Git, then prepared patch and helper scripts.
     - User installed Git locally and executed scripts which:
       - Initialized repo, set origin to https://github.com/Zorentha/football-betting-app.git, created branch feature/openai-expected-output-tokens, committed changes, and pushed branch to origin.
     - Assistant created prefilled PR link and helped install gh CLI; user installed gh via helper script and attempted gh pr create; gh wasn't available initially but subsequently installed; user reported missing green button; assistant iterated UI steps and determined overlay/menu blocked the button and provided direct PR link. Despite UI oddities user couldn't find green button; assistant supplied link and described exact area to click.
   - Specific terminal commands run by assistant / user:
     - curl POST to /api/betting/openai/analyze -> saved response to tmp/annotate_strict_response_1435547.json
     - node scripts/save-annotated-to-db.js -> saved DB prediction, returned row id: 218
     - node scripts/run-unit-tests.js -> tests passed
     - Helper push commands executed locally by user (via scripts/run_push_with_url.sh and scripts/fix_identity_and_push.sh) — created branch and pushed successfully.
     - PowerShell script scripts/install_gh_windows.ps1 used to install gh; it downloaded and installed gh successfully.

5. Pending Tasks (explicit user requests or required next steps):
   - Create the Pull Request (user sought help; assistant provided link). User must click the green "Create pull request" on the prefilled PR page or use gh to create it. Assistant provided the link:
     - https://github.com/Zorentha/football-betting-app/pull/new/feature/openai-expected-output-tokens?... (prefilled)
   - Frontend verification by user: open app in browser (Vite server running) and confirm the per-tip probabilities and calibrationVersion display correctly in AIAnalysis and MatchCard.
   - CI monitoring: ensure .github/workflows/ci.yml runs on PR and passes unit tests & DB persistence smoke test.
   - Optionally: add reviewers/labels to PR; assistant offered to create PR via gh CLI but gh was not present initially; after gh installation user can run gh pr create or click the prefilled link.
   - Clean up / documentation: update README/.env.example with the recommended OPENAI_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_TOKENS guidance (already done).
   - Add code review / merge once PR approved.

6. Current Work (immediately before this summary):
   - The last active user issue: they could not find the green "Create pull request" button on the GitHub compare page; multiple screenshots showed the compare UI with the message "There isn't anything to compare" even though diffs are shown.
   - Assistant actions immediately before this message:
     - Provided detailed step-by-step UI guidance for creating PR via web UI.
     - Produced prefilled PR link and asked user to click the green button.
     - Assisted user to install gh and to run gh pr create (user installed gh but gh was not initially recognized; then installed and reattempted).
     - Created helper scripts to push and to install gh; user executed them locally; branch push completed successfully.
   - Code files last edited just before this summary:
     - src/components/AIAnalysis.jsx (added calibrationVersion and per-tip probability display)
     - src/components/MatchCard.jsx (added compact calibration & top recommendation)
     - src/services/openaiAnalysisService.js (token cap made configurable; calibration logic)
     - scripts/* helpers for push and install

7. Optional Next Step (direct, in-line with most recent user intent):
   - The user explicitly wants the PR created. The direct next step is to open the prefilled PR link and click "Create pull request" — assistant already provided the link.
   - If the green button is not visible due to UI overlay or a GitHub compare special-case (the "entirely different commit histories" notice), the assistant's alternative is to create a PR URL which the assistant already supplied — the user should open that link in the browser, then scroll to the right side of the page (right upper area) to find the "Create pull request" button (or, if still obscured, close any open avatar/menu overlays and retry).
   - If the user prefers, assistant can also craft the exact gh command for creation (already provided) and the user can run it in their environment once gh is available. The assistant can execute gh locally only if gh is available in this environment (not allowed); user will run locally.
   - Verbatim recent user instruction indicating where work left off:
     - User: "Po kliknięciu w Compare & pull request widzę to" (then provided screenshots) and: "jestem zalogowany do git tu w Visual studio, czy masz do niego dostęp?" — assistant proceeded with push and gh install flow. The user repeatedly insisted that the green button is not visible and wants the assistant to analyze the screen and "do it right".

8. Notes / Final status:
   - Annotated betting tips for fixture 1435547 were generated by ChatGPT‑5 and saved as raw JSON in tmp/annotate_strict_response_1435547.json (model returned integer per-tip probabilities as required).
   - The user confirmed saving to DB; scripts/save-annotated-to-db.js ran and DB row id 218 was returned.
   - OpenAI token cap was removed from code and made configurable via OPENAI_EXPECTED_OUTPUT_TOKENS env var; unit tests passed.
   - Frontend updated to display per-tip integer probabilities and calibrationVersion; recommended UI verification via running dev server (Vite started locally on different port).
   - Git and gh CLI installation and push were performed by the user locally with assistant-supplied scripts; branch feature/openai-expected-output-tokens was pushed to origin.
   - Assistant provided a prefilled PR link and extensive UI guidance; the user still cannot see the green button due to the compare UI state or overlay — the assistant provided multiple alternatives (direct URL, gh CLI) and troubleshooting steps (close avatar menu, select compare branch properly, use expand flag).

If you want, next immediate actions I will take after your confirmation:
- If you confirm you want me to, I will:
  - Generate an alternative PR creation URL variant (swap base/compare) and give it to you to try.
  - Or prepare a short script snippet you can paste to run gh pr create (if gh installed) — ready to provide that now.
  - Or, if you paste the exact URL currently in your browser, I will inspect its parameters and produce a corrected direct PR URL to open.
