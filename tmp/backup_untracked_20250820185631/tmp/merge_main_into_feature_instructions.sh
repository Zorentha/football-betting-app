# Copy/paste these commands into Git Bash (run from your repo root).
# This will fetch origin, ensure you are on the feature branch, and merge main into it,
# allowing unrelated histories if needed. It will also push the merged branch to origin.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Inspect and resolve any merge conflicts manually if they appear.
# - Do NOT run these if you are unsure; create a backup branch first:
#     git branch backup-feature-before-merge
#
# Commands (copy all lines and paste into Git Bash):

# 1) Fetch latest from origin
git fetch origin

# 2) Ensure local main is up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 3) Switch to your feature branch
git checkout feature/openai-expected-output-tokens

# 4) (Optional) create a backup branch before merge
git branch backup-feature-before-merge

# 5) Merge main into feature allowing unrelated histories
#    This uses the --allow-unrelated-histories flag to permit merge if histories differ.
git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories

# 6) If conflicts appear, resolve them:
#    - Inspect files with conflicts: git status
#    - Edit conflicted files to resolve, then:
#      git add <file1> <file2>
#      git commit
#    Or if you want to abort merge:
#      git merge --abort

# 7) Push merged branch to origin
git push origin feature/openai-expected-output-tokens

# 8) After push, open PR or update existing PR â€” the PR will reflect merged main into feature.
#    If you need, create PR via gh or the GitHub UI.

# End of script.
