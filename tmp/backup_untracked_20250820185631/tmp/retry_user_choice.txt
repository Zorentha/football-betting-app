User decision summary:
- User chose option 3: "Nie wykonywać dalszych działań teraz — tylko zostawić procesy uruchomione."
- Current state (as of this timestamp):
  * Retry pass for timeout fixtures is running (scripts/retry-timeout-fixtures.js).
  * Watcher logging successes: scripts/watch-retry-successes.js (writes tmp/retry-seen.json and appends to tmp/retry_status.txt).
  * Auto-run monitor: scripts/auto-run-after-retry.js is running and will trigger generate/import (dry-run) after retries complete.
  * Backend was restarted and a new node server.js process was started.
  * Frontend (Vite) restart attempted (npm run dev started via npm.cmd).

Recommended next steps (manual actions you may run later):
1) Wait for auto-run to finish and inspect:
   - tmp/generate-analysis-report.output.txt
   - tmp/import-tmp-analyses.dryrun.output.txt
   - tmp/retry_status.txt
   - tmp/retry-seen.json
2) If dry-run import looks correct, run:
   - node scripts/import-tmp-analyses.js --apply
3) Consider adding backoff + maxRetries to scripts/retry-error-analyses.js for long-term stability.
4) Prepare deployment checklist before production deploy (backups, env, healthchecks, rollback steps).

If you want me to perform any of the recommended steps now, respond with the number of the step and I will proceed.
