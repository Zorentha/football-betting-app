Quick copy-paste commands to create the PR locally (pick the one for your shell)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT paste your PAT into chat. Run these locally and paste only the command output here.

1) Git Bash (paste as a single line)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_<YOUR_PAT_HERE>" && curl -v -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -d '{"title":"Make OpenAI expected output tokens configurable and remove hardcoded cap","head":"feature/openai-expected-output-tokens","base":"main","body":"See PR_DESCRIPTION.md in repository for full details."}' https://api.github.com/repos/Zorentha/football-betting-app/pulls

2) PowerShell (paste as a single line)
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'ghp_<YOUR_PAT_HERE>'; curl.exe -v -H "Authorization: token $env:GITHUB_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -d '{"title":"Make OpenAI expected output tokens configurable and remove hardcoded cap","head":"feature/openai-expected-output-tokens","base":"main","body":"See PR_DESCRIPTION.md in repository for full details."}' https://api.github.com/repos/Zorentha/football-betting-app/pulls

3) If you prefer the helper script (prints the commands), run this in Git Bash:
bash scripts/run_create_pr_local.sh
-> Copy the printed curl line, then run it after setting GITHUB_TOKEN as in (1).

What to paste back here:
- The full curl output (JSON). If successful, it contains "html_url": "https://github.com/...." â€” paste that URL here.
- If it fails, paste the entire output (do NOT include your token).

Notes based on current repo state (what I checked for you):
- I verified remote branches: origin/feature/openai-expected-output-tokens (SHA 041051d...) and origin/main (SHA e65ecf3...).
- There is no common ancestor between those branches (merge-base empty), so I created and pushed a rebased branch earlier (feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased). If you want PR from that branch instead, replace "feature/openai-expected-output-tokens" with "feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased" in the commands above (head).
- If you want me to create the PR from the rebased branch instead, run with head "feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased".

Example (Git Bash) for the rebased branch:
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_<YOUR_PAT_HERE>" && curl -v -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -d '{"title":"Make OpenAI expected output tokens configurable and remove hardcoded cap","head":"feature/openai-expected-output-tokens-rebased","base":"main","body":"See PR_DESCRIPTION.md in repository for full details."}' https://api.github.com/repos/Zorentha/football-betting-app/pulls

End.
